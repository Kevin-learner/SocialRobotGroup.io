## Group Work

### Case Description
ROSE (Robot Operating System Environment) is a social robot development platform based on ROS, often using the TIAGo robot manufactured by PAL Robotics as its hardware foundation. TIAGo is a multifunctional robot that integrates a mobile base, robotic arm, elevating torso, and a variety of sensors (such as lidar, RGB-D cameras, etc.), and is widely used in research, education, and human-robot interaction fields. 
Our case is to apply the ROSE robot in elderly care to accomplish three applications. These three applications are respectively: helping the elderly obtain things that are difficult to get; Keep the living environment clean and tidy. And also assist the elderly in conducting self-assessment of their own health status: such as measuring blood pressure every morning, conducting urine tests, and other behaviors.

#### Story Boarding
References:

Through a case of medical caring team with patients, doctors and robots, we are informed that: Through the visual narrative framework, the multiple perspectives of caregivers, patients and medical staff are integrated to transform abstract needs into concrete scenarios (such as daily auxiliary scenarios), revealing the potential paths of technological intervention. The core significance lies in breaking through the limitations of traditional demand research, using co-created storyboards to stimulate participants' imagination of robot application scenarios, simultaneously capturing functional requirements and humanistic care demands, providing a decision-making basis that takes into account both practicality and emotional adaptability for technical design, and ultimately achieving a precise connection between technological innovation and real user needs.

#### Wizard of Oz
References:

Wizard of Oz, through the design of restricted perception experiments, simulates the perception and behavioral limitations in the real interaction scenarios of robots, enabling human experts (" guides ") to dynamically generate interaction strategies based only on the limited information available to robots. By limiting the perception range of the guide (aligning with the sensor capabilities of the robot), the non-portability of the strategy caused by the "omniscient perspective" of human experts in traditional methods is avoided, and the adaptability of the strategy to the actual capabilities of the robot is improved. The interaction behavior data collected under restricted conditions can be directly transformed into the autonomous control logic of the robot, reducing the "reality gap" in the subsequent algorithm development.

Sequeira et al., "Discovering social interaction strategies for robots from restricted-perception Wizard-of-Oz studies," 2016 11th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Christchurch, New Zealand, 2016, pp. 197-204, doi: 10.1109/HRI.2016.7451752.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7451752)







#### Lego Series


### Senarios
Low user trust/low robot understanding:
70-year-old Bob was influenced by science fiction movies and believed that robots were villains who would rule the earth, so he did not trust and was afraid of robots.
Bob felt uncomfortable in his heart and sat on the sofa, holding his chest and breathing, but did not speak. The robot could not recognize the meaning of Bob's subtle movements and thought that Bob was dancing, and began to ask Bob if he needed to play music to accompany him.
Bob said sarcastically, "You are so smart", and the robot responded, "Thank you for the compliment, I will continue to work hard"

Problems with this scenario response:
The robot lacks "micro-movement" and "micro-expression" recognition, cannot understand the intention represented by human movements, lacks a model for emotional context analysis, and cannot recognize the emotions expressed by humans through voice intonation.

## Reflections

### How is Design Research linked to HRI
Design research, through human-centered approaches, helps to deeply understand the real needs, emotions and behavioral responses of users when interacting with robots. Through observation, interviews and prototype testing, design research reveals details that are often overlooked in traditional technology development, such as trust, natural communication and social acceptance, thereby promoting HRI systems to become more natural, efficient and enjoyable. It prompts the shift of human-robot interaction from "technology-centered" to "experience-centered", achieving better social integration.

### Digital (AI) vs Embodiment
In the design of social robots, digital AI (chatbots) have significant limitations compared to physical robots. Take for example toys that are physical entities. The sense of satisfaction and warmth that one gets from hugging a plush toy is definitely quite different from that of hugging a cold steel block. Not to mention digital AI that has no physical form at all. Robots with physical forms will give users a more intuitive first impression, demonstrating their inherent functions and providing more interaction methods with users. In reality, people's communication involves various senses such as vision, hearing, smell and touch. However, chatbots AI are unable to meet these needs. Or rather, they can only partially observe these aspects of humans in a one-way manner. This can lead to a sense of distrust and communication barriers.

### Why is "HER" (not) a Compelling Argument?
I find it unpersuasive that someone could fall in love with an intangible AI. I myself experienced a long-distance relationship. Although we can now communicate through video calls, it still can't bridge the gap of deepening distrust and estrangement. Eventually, this relationship ended in a breakup.

### The Robot Revolution: When?
When the social productive forces are developing at an extremely rapid pace, and when people not only need robots in the production field but also in terms of quality of life, the robot revolution will arrive.

### The Dinosaur Hotel
The "Dinosaur Hotel" in Japan (Henn na Hotel) initially attracted much attention with its robot receptionists and fully automated services, reflecting people's expectations for future technological hotels. However, the actual operational results were not satisfactory. Many robots were unable to effectively handle complex or unconventional customer demands, such as not being able to understand customers' questions, misidentifying in noisy environments, and lacking the ability to handle emergencies. This led to a decline in guest experience, and eventually the hotel had to rehire a large number of human employees. 
This reflects an important issue: In the service industry, "cool novelty" cannot truly replace "flexibility, empathy and judgment". Although robots have advantages in performing simple and repetitive tasks, when faced with rich and diverse actual scenarios, robots lacking contextual understanding and emotional responses find it difficult to provide satisfactory service experiences. Especially in environments like hotels that emphasize personalized reception and delicate care, purely pursuing efficiency can actually undermine the overall experience of customers.

### Nabaztag
As an early internet-connected pet robot, Nabaztag won the affection of many users in the early stage with its cute appearance and basic internet functions (such as reading the weather, email reminders, swaying ears, etc.). It successfully seized the novel concept of "Internet of Things cute pets", making the interaction between humans and technology more intimate and interesting. However, as time went by, the limitations of Nabaztag gradually became apparent. Its interaction capabilities were limited, updates were slow, and it couldn't continuously meet users' expectations for "companionship" and "intelligence" that were constantly improving. People soon lost interest in simple notifications and mechanical actions, and the lack of emotional deepening connections also made it difficult for them to form a long-term reliance. 
This indicates that in the design of social robots, merely relying on novelty and appearance to attract attention is far from sufficient. What users truly desire is an intelligent companion that can continuously evolve, understand them, and establish emotional connections. When robots fail to grow along with changes in user needs, the initial curiosity will soon fade away, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the product.

### Cuddlebits
Cuddlebits can evoke more resonance and protective instincts in people through subtle movements (such as quivering and curling up) and natural reactions to touch. This "soft and vivid" characteristic makes them more like real small animals, thereby triggering people's instinctive concern and emotional investment. 
This indicates that in the human-machine emotional relationship, "high intelligence" is not the key to touching people's hearts. On the contrary, traits such as being soft, vulnerable, and needing care are more likely to trigger deep emotional connections. The design of Cuddlebits reminds us that truly effective human-machine interaction does not necessarily require complex language and task completion capabilities. Sometimes, a simple, touchable and understandable little being is enough to establish a strong emotional bond.

### Be-Right-Back
The concept of "Be-right-back" originates from the idea of using artificial intelligence technology to "revive" the deceased relatives. For instance, through chat records and social media data, a "digital personality" can be reconstructed. Although this technology can bring comfort to those who have lost their loved ones in the short term, it also raises profound ethical and emotional issues. Firstly, the simulated "existence" is never truly human; it lacks independent growth and genuine emotions. Secondly, this technology may delay the normal mourning process of people, turning sadness into a reliance on false connections. 
This reflection reminds us that technology can reproduce language and behavioral patterns, but it cannot truly replicate the unique and profound emotional relationships between people. In the face of loss, humans need memory and acceptance rather than remaining stuck in a false "farewell" forever. Therefore, although "be-right-back" is tempting from a technical perspective, from the viewpoints of emotional health and ethics, it is not a truly desirable solution.

### Sci-fi prototyping
The prototype design based on science fiction novels can easily demonstrate the philosophical contemplations of different people on a certain scientific phenomenon, because novels are ultimately supposed to serve the purpose of shaping the protagonists. As for the plot of the novel, the functions of the prototype of the robot might be described in a more coherent way. However, in science fiction novels, in order to create dramatic conflicts, extreme situations can be simulated. In such cases, the story becomes less credible.

### 21st century robot project
The aspect that most impresses me about this project is that it emphasizes not merely building a "machine" that can move and speak, but creating an "existence" that has a story, a motivation, and can be understood and accepted by humans. In my view, this design approach of robots with personality shaping and social role setting is the key that distinguishes social robots from traditional automated devices. 
It also made me reflect that perhaps we are too prone to equate "high intelligence" with "good robots"? Maybe a little robot that can understand your silence and quietly accompany you when you are down is far more meaningful in reality than an "intelligent butler" that can solve complex mathematical problems. This project reminds me that true design is not just about solving problems, but about constructing meaning and relationships.

### Rosy consumer stories
"Rosy Consumer Stories" made me realize that users' expectations of social robots are often idealized, romanticized or even surreal. People hope that robots can not only complete tasks efficiently, but also understand, accompany and respond to emotions like friends. These "rosy" consumption stories, though seemingly unrealistic, truly reflect people's emotional desires and psychological projections when facing technology.


### Importance of storytelling for HRI specifically
In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), storytelling is not merely a means of communication but also a crucial way to endow robots with personalities, intentions and emotions. Compared with the cold and command-style dialogues, stories can make robots appear more "lively" and more likely to evoke emotional resonance from users. A robot with a background, goals and "personality" is often more trustworthy, likable, and even given a "companion-like" status. 
HRI is not merely a technical issue of speech recognition and path planning, but rather about the construction of "relationships". Telling stories can create a "comprehensible motivational framework" for robots, allowing users to understand why they perform certain behaviors, thereby reducing uncertainty and discomfort. This is particularly important when humans interact with unfamiliar technologies.

### Evidence based work (health) vs robot stories (and perceived competence)
Although storytelling can enhance the emotional connection between robots and users, in a medical environment, robots also need to demonstrate their professional competence and reliability. Therefore, designers need to strike a balance between emotional communication and professional performance to increase users' trust and acceptance of robots.
